* Explanation of the various lists
*

Thread element
--------------
*    0,U - pointer to next element
*    2,U - code entry point
*    7,U - pointer to shape
* the rest of the data is thread-specific


Shape element
-------------
*    2,X - address of current raster
*    4,X - destination on screen (word)
*    6,X - pointer to thread
*    8,X - pointer to code ?
*   10,X - msbyte of x?
*   12,X - lsbyte of x?
*   14,X - x (word)
*   16,X - y (word)
*   18,X - MSBit indicates left/right nybble
*   20,X - address of shape table
*   22,X - 


$9900 pool
----------
Pool has 180 elements, each 24 bytes.

Free list head pointer is at $1B.

Elements in this list are moved into several different lists.
Active head list pointers are at $17, $1F, $21 and $23.

Format:
	0,1 - link to next element


$A9E0 list
----------
This is the main thread list.
List has 120 elements, each 15 bytes.

Active list head pointer is at $11.
Free   list head pointer is at $13.

Format:
	0,1	- link to next element
	2,3	- entry address
	4	- 1
	5	- period
	6	- 0; used to differentiate between this and $B0E8 elements

When an element is installed, it is placed before the current thread.


$B0E8 list
----------
List has 20 elements, each 31 bytes.

Free list head pointer is at $1D

Format:
	0,1	- link to next element
	2,3	- entry address
	4	- 1
	5	- period
	6	- 1; used to differentiate between this and $A9E0 elements

This is not a thread list dispatched by the heart of Robotron, but
perhaps from a secondary thread dispatcher...


$B354 list ($B354-$B3A3)
----------
List of 80 pointers, probably to active humans

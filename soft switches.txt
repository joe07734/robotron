	Read:
	Bit 0 - move up
	Bit 1 - move down
	Bit 2 - move left
	Bit 3 - move right
	Bit 4 - start 1
	Bit 5 - start 2
	Bit 6 - fire up
	Bit 7 - fire down
C805 -	PIA2 control
	cold boot code D118 clears it then sets it to $34
C806 -	PIA3
	Read:
	Bit 0 - fire left

	Bit 7 - cocktail
	Write?:
	CB2 output switch MUX control 1 = player 1, 0 = player 2
C807 -	PIA3 control
	cold boot code D118 clears it then sets it to $3C
	D4FC sets it to $3C
	D503 sets it to $34
C80C -	PIA0
	Read:
	Bit 0 - auto up

	Write:
	CA2 - 7 segment display bit 3
	CA1 IRQ 240 (16 MS) (line 240)
C80D -	PIA0 control
	cold boot code D118 clears it then sets it to $34
C80E -	PIA1
	Read:
	Bit 0-5 - sound
	Bit 6-7 - 7 segment display bits 0, 1
	Write:
	CB1 IRQ 4 MS (0, $40, $80, $C0)
	CB2 - 7 segment display bit 2
C80F -	PIA1 control
	cold boot code D118 clears it then sets it to $35
C900 -	?shadow kept in $9845
	Bit 0 - 1 rom read; 0 ram read (bank switch)
	Bit 1 - 1 invert; 0 normal screen (cocktail switching)

CA00	- invoke a blit. bits control behavior:
	Bit 7 - Do not process half the byte 4-7
	Bit 6 - Do not process half the byte 0-3
	Bit 5 - Shift the shape one pixel right (to display a shape on an odd pixel)
	Bit 4 - Remap, if shape != 0 then pixel = mask
	Bit 3 - Source  1 = take source 0 = take Mask only
	Bit 2 - ?
	Bit 1 - Transparent
	Bit 0 -
CA01	- blitter mode?
	  	$00 - erase? (write black for non-black src pixels)
	  	$66
	  	$CC
CA02,3	- address of shape raster
CA04,5	- destination on screen
CA06	- width, EOR #$04
CA07	- height, EOR #$04


CB00	- 6 bits of the video counters bits 2-7

CBFF	- watchdog (write $39 = reset)
CC00-CFFF - CMOS ram
